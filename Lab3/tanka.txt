Bursting, profusion.
White, pink petals cascading.
Burgeoning blossom.
Whilst we, in isolation,
Watch nature’s recreation...
ocean cries
as tears of crystal
overflow the land
Earths womb gives birth
to many newborns.
sunsets are amazing ,
a stunning sight to behold.
my eyes are failing,
youth is fleeting,I ponder
will I witness this again?
Snow falls filigree,
the flakes endlessly drifting
beyond my window-
Weeping, I pen a poem
and with emotion sketch myself
a summer sky
of orange
crystal river flowing
swiftly westward
trout leaps
Muddy waves, foam and the storm
All settled in my teapot
As nature stirring outside
My own spoon rustling inside
Will all settle in due time?
snow blankets the ground
crystal stars melt together
form a field of white
in the silence of winter
paw prints trace a zig-zag path
red sky above
silver crested waves
full of seagulls
breaching dolphins
grey arches.
now the pines we grew
begin to touch each other
gently as we planned
chair just here and wine just there
you'd hear those wood doves I hear
this sultry evening
I mistake your eyes for two
hovering fireflies
such stillness only the dead
and the truly happy know
hot sun, burgundy
cherries dip above my head,
bleed under my feet,
our presence blesses our walk
we trail happiness like smoke
Lightning Bugs in jars
Serve as night lights in our room.
Crickets chirp in the air.
Summer nights are made for fun
And one more bowl of ice cream.
As harvest ripens,
Dog-days signal our term’s reap.
As citrus withers,
Romance turns a bittersweet.
Our passion, ‘round Solstice, turned.
bullfrog pond ripples
water lilies bob in sync
our fire licks the sky
watching the august sun set
gold stars mirrored in your eyes
on this sultry day
among the drooping flowers
only the bees stir
your scent on a handkerchief
makes hope murmur in my heart
Heat, glorious heat
Ice melts on our pink tongues
Cooling our skin
Warming our frozen hearts
My hand fits nicely in yours.
