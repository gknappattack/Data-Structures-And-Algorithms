# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms
Coursework and projects for BYU CS 235 Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Course Outcomes: 

- Use the fundamental data types of computing (lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, maps, trees, etc.).

- Understand the major techniques for implementing the fundamental data types (linked lists, binary search trees, hashing, heaps, etc.) and implement several of them.

- Properly use and select data structures from language-provided data-structure libraries.

- Apply basic algorithm analysis.

- Understand how recursion works and write programs using recursion to solve problems.

- Make informed decisions about which sorting and searching algorithms to use in specific circumstances.

- Write programs that require ~500 lines of code.
